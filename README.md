# RAFT-Distributed-and-Replicated-File-Storage-system
Java implementation of a distributed and replicated online file storage over a cluster of file servers, kept redundant and always up to date. The system exploits the RAFT algorithm which is a well known solution in this kind of problems, allowing a higher understandability than PAXOS.
